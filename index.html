          This was a very important invention to mankind, this is one of the most widely used inventions today, this makes it easier for us to communicate with others in such a way that we don’t need to leave our house.

          The world would be very different as we would need to meet up to do some things, we wouldn’t be able to work at home and have to go out of our house. In order to communicate with others, we would have to meet them and can’t just call or text them. This would also be very different in terms of safety, if you get lost, it would be hard to come in contact with your family, there could also be more robbing.</p>

        <h2>The People Who Made The Internet</h2>
        
        <p> 
          The people who created the internet were Vint Cerf and Bob Khan. They are credited for creating the internet although there are still others that may have also helped.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people seem to not know the creators of the internet, so now that you have seen this, you should also share it with others! These people get credited very little so this can be our way of thanking them.

      <div class= "Interesting">
        <h3>Some Interesting Things</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There are about 1.7b websites on the internet.</li>
          <li>Google is the most famous website.</li>

        <h4>A little more on it's importance</h4>

        <p>
          We use this everyday in talking to others without having to meet up. We also use this when searching for something. Our lives would be really hard, there would be many problems making it very hard.

          This is also why we should be thankful to the creators as it would be very hard to live in that kind of world.
